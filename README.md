## Virtual Pill Box

This app will function as a virtual pill box for a user.  It intends to remind and inform the user of the medications they are taking and when to take them.  They will be able to see their usage history as well as get information regarding the medication, such as what the pill looks like and any side effects that the user should be aware of.  If not too difficult, the exciting feature of this app will be to be able to take a picture and have the information already populate that is listed on a prescription bottle.  It is possible that this app will be built using React Native as a mobile app makes the most sense for this type of project.

* As a user, I want to remind myself to take my medication, so that I do not forget.
* As a user, I want to be able to add a medication to my list, so that I can keep track of all of my medications.
* As a user, I want to track my history of medication usage, so that I can see if I am using my medication as prescribed.  
* As a user, I want to be able to access a refill screen, so that I can make appts with my drs when I am out of medication, or request a refill from the pharmacy.
* As a user, I want to be able to view information about my medication, so that I am aware of side effects, etc.
* As a user, I want the ability to visually see what my medication looks like, so that I am sure that I am taking the correct pill.
* As a user, I would like the ability to login, so that my personal medical history is protected.
